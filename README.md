# Counting Rod Keyboard

Counting Rod Keyboard is a numeric input method for Android. Despite using [Southern Song rod numerals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_rods) for typeface, it doesn't actually input these numerals. It instead can only be used to input ASCII digits. This is especially useful when entering passwords.

This keyboard makes it harder (for someone else) to figure out what you're entering (given that the entered characters are hidden) by using as the typeface the rod numerals, which, unlike Roman numerals, are almost no longer used these days.

## Note

* Due to the fact that [Suzhou numerals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzhou_numerals), a numeral system derived from rod numerals, are still used in Hong Kong, this keyboard, as a tool to secretly enter passwords, might not be as useful there as in other places.
